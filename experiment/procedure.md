In this experiment there are two parts.

i) Check flatness of test objects

ii) Optical flat as comparator


1. Click on 'Experiment Parts' button. Choose 'Check flatness of test objects'.

2. Now select 'Test surface 1' after clicking on 'Choose test surface'.

3. Select 'Regular' after clicking on 'Choose optical flat'.

4. Switch on the monochromatic light source by clicking on the toggle switch and observe the fringes appeared. They are equispaced regular light and dark lines, indicating tentatively flat surface.

5. Switch off the light source. Check flatness of other surfaces with different optical flats similarly.

6. Click on 'Experiment Parts' button again. Choose 'Optical flat as comparator'. A master gauge and a sample slip gauge will be there in the flat platform of the light source setup. Each of them having width of 15 mm, kept at a distance of 30 mm from each other.

7. Select 'Regular' after clicking on 'Choose optical flat'.

8. Switch on the monochromatic light source by clicking on the toggle switch and observe the fringes appeared.
the total number of fringes ( n ) will be shown in corresponding box. Switch off the light.

9. Click on 'Calculate' to get the true height of the sample gauge ( mm ).

10. Click on 'Table' at the bottom of the page to see the observation table and click on 'Add to Table' button to fill the first row of the observation table.

11. Again follow steps 8-9 and click on 'Add to Table' button again to get the second observation.

12. Similarly follow steps 8-9 and click on 'Add to Table' button again to get another three observations.
